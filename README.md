# Example4_ggplot_polygenic_score_power

Statistical power for testing differences in genetic risk of disease across populations.

Figure showes power curves generated from a simulation study.

Simulations from a range of genetic architectures based on polygenicity, p.

F_ST denotes genetic divergence between populations.
